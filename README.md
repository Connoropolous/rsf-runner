Welcome to the Rapid Sensemaking Framework ecosystem entry point!


## What Is The "Rapid Sensemaking Framework"?

The rapid sensemaking framework is a set of tools designed to facilitate human conversation, ideation, and reasoning at a large scale.

Common processes for gathering human expressions (be they ideas, questions, claims, votes, edits, etc) are encoded as pluggable open-source modules that can reach across the various digital devices and applications we commonly use.

Skilled facilitators and process designers can use the rapid sensemaking framework to conduct and unfold processes for ideation, discussion, evaluation, and decision making.

Inspirations and related projects include the likes of
- [Kialo](https://www.kialo.com/)
    - tool to engage in thoughtful discussion, understand different points of view, and help with collaborative decision-making
- [Pol.is](https://pol.is/home)
    - helps organizations understand themselves by visualizing what their members think. Get a clear picture of all the points of view to help move a conversation forward.
- [Groupmap](https://www.groupmap.com/)
    - capturing individual thinking, revealing the group perspective, all in real-time. Collaborative decision making.
- [All Our Ideas](https://www.allourideas.org/)
    - start with a question and some seed ideas and create a "wiki survey". The best ideas bubble to the top.
- [Codigital](https://www.codigital.com/)
    - "Real-Time Ideas Engine". For large groups to generate, prioritize and refine ideas.
- [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/)
    - helps people have discussions and make decisions together
- [Assembl](https://bluenove.com/en/offers/assembl/)
    - massive collective intelligence is the capacity to mobilize communities on a large scale (hundreds and thousands of participants) around key stakes and challenges to co-create new solutions in a short space of time
- [IdeaLoom](https://www.idealoom.org/)
    - sister project to Assembl
    - allows large communities to hold a meaningful conversation at scale, reach a common understanding, and develop solutions beyond what each participant could have envisioned

The basic tenets are
- ideation
- evaluation and ranking, sorting
- selection, voting, consenting


Apart from a few integrations, such as ones that Loomio has with Slack, these platforms require participants to join a new platform, and familiarize with a new tool. The RSF assumes the opposite, and brings the conversation to an already familiar space to participants: a chat platform they're already using. The process designer can even specify different people as reachable on DIFFERENT platforms, and the process can still be conducted.
